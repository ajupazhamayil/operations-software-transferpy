- Move the transfer framework to its module named transferpy.
- Modularize transferpy into three modules and a RemoteExecution:

    * The :any:`Transferer <transferpy.Transferer>` class is responsible for the act on the user arguments and make
      the send/receive possible.
    * The :any:`Firewall <transferpy.Firewall>` class is for open/close the ports in the iptables
      to receive the data by the receiver machines.
    * :any:`MariaDB <transferpy.MariaDB>`
    * The :any:`RemoteExecution <transferpy.RemoteExecution.CuminExecution>` is the module responsible for the
      execution of command on the remote machines.

       + transfer framework mainly uses the Cumin execution.

- Give proper comments to newly created modules.
- Make `--help` option useful to the user.
- Make documentation using Sphinx (This).
- Remove unimportant output of Cumin from the console
  :any:`CuminExecution.run <transferpy.RemoteExecution.CuminExecution.CuminExecution.run>`
- Detect a free port automatically on the target machine for the Netcat to listen
  :any:`Firewall.find_available_port <transferpy.Firewall.Firewall.find_available_port>`.
- Seperate WMFMariadbpy and transferpy to its own repositories.
- Make Debian transferpy package.
